game ideas:

two phases of game loop:
scavenge phase ( search house for randomly generated weapons ( inside of containers such as drawers ) )
tame phase ( try and tame the cat )

taming the cat is dealing enough 'damage' to it so that it becomes friendly
each cat gets their own phase two

boba: can eat food to heal
bean: hops on the wheel which allows her to knock it over and roll it around
gerry: becomes more aggresive and 'out of control'
